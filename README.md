# Aureole Suite
###### A suite of tools for modding and datamining the early Trails/軌跡 games

Most of the documentation is [here](https://aureole.kyuuhachi.dev/book) (though it's rather lackluster).

## Park Block - Calmare
Calmare is a decompiler and recompiler for script files.
It can currently handle the scenario scripts for all games from Sky FC up through Azure.

In the future it is intended to also support animation/battle scripts, tables, and a number of other auxiliary files.

There is a short tutorial [here](https://aureole.kyuuhachi.dev/book/guide/).

## Residential Block - Cradle
Cradle is a converter for Falcom's image, sprite, and (planned) 3D model files
to and from more conventional formats.

## Industrial Block - Factoria

Factoria is a tool for managing the file archived used in the *Trails in the
Sky* trilogy. It can extract, edit, and create archives from scratch.

## Substratum Access Passages — LB-ARK

The Liberl Archive Redirection Kludge is a dll hook for the *Trails in the Sky*
trilogy, simplifying mod development and distribution. Due to its different
nature, it is hosted in a [different repo](https://github.com/Kyuuhachi/LB-ARK/).
